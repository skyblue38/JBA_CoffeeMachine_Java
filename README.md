### Coffee Machine (Project)
This project allows you to better understand the basic OOP, its main concepts such as classes, class methods and attributes, and get a taste of Java. 
Practice working with methods, challenge yourself with loops and conditions, and get more confident with OOP.

What can be better than a cup of coffee during a break? A coffee that you don?t have to make yourself. 
It's enough to press a couple of buttons on the machine and you get a cup of energy; but first, we should teach the machine how to do it. 
In this project, you will work on programming a coffee machine simulator. 
The machine works with typical products: coffee, milk, sugar, and plastic cups; if it runs out of something, it shows a notification. 
You can get three types of coffee: espresso, cappuccino and latte. 
Since nothing's for free, it also collects the money.
